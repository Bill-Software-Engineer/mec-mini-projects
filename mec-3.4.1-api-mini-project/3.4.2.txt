Questions to ask:

What's our target events on Twitter?  What data do we want to pull?  It say to analyze reactions of people.  Is there a volume target?
Do we have access to Twitter's API?  Most company have access limit, ie: max call per minute or per day.
If not, then who is going to build the web scraper?
Where would we store the data?
What kind of reaction are we looking for?  Just approve/disapprove?  Or different kind of emotions?
What kind model do we want to build?
How would the results be accessed by maangement?  On internal webpage?  On a report?  
Will the report be kept up to date?
Will data continue to be streamed in?
Is this a snapshot?
